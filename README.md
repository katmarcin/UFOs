# UFOs

 ## Overview of Project
 
 An in-depth analysis of UFO sightings was performed on a JS script file with sighting information. We partnered with Dana, a Data Journalist, to build a webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it. The website created allows users to filter UFO data per their search preferences: date, city, state, country, shape. In order to build this page, a table was created first from UFO data that was stored as a Javascript array. This table is then manipulated/filtered based on certain criteria. Lastly, by placing this table into an HTML file, users can view it with ease. Bootstrap was used to to customize page and equip the table with fully functional filters so users can interact with it. 

 
### Tools:

Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap 

### Dataset: 

data.js (UFO data)
 
 
 ## Results
 
 ###
 
Navigating this webpage consists of a very simple process of using the search criteria. The criteria users can filter by include date, city, state, country, and shape. The entire dataset is pre-filled on the homepage prior to even beginning to filter the data so we can glance at the format of each criteria prior to entering our desired input. For instance, in the date criteria, we should aim to enter our date in the format of: "1/10/2010" as an example. These limitations are derived from the dataset itself, therefore it is imperative that we filter the data to reflect the data exemplified on the page already. If we enter "01/10/2010," nothing would be produced in the table. 

a. Example of data filtered by date: 1/13/2010.


 
 
 There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
